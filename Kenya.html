               <p>
                   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya">U.S.A</a> Kenya was the most genuine, helpful, kind, place I have 
                   ever visited. It was like stepping into another world. Everyone was wonderful, Kenya has definitely taken conservation 
                   and hospitality to the next level. I believe that Kenya is the best place to visit in all of Africa. Definitely 
                   something that nature lovers have to put on their bucket list. i lived in kenya,Nairobi for about 5 months and i still miss the buses i used to travell on.

                <h3>Nairobi</h3>
                <P>
                    went to Nairobi National Park and stay at eco-friendly camps and enjoy the game drives seeing abundance of wild animals. 
                    Then you can also visit the Giraffe Manor and the Elephant orphanage. food wise Nairobi got it all.
                    <strong> you should visit the place.</strong>
