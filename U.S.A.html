                <h3>Space Center Houston</h3>
                <P>
                    It consists of a complex of 100 buildings constructed on 1,620 acres (660 hectares) in the Clear Lake Area of Houston, which acquired the official nickname "Space City" in 1967. The center is 
                    home to NASA's astronaut corps, and is responsible for training astronauts from both the US and its international partners.
                    <strong> you should visit the place.</strong>
                </P>
