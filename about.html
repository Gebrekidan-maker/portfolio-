      <div class="Description">
        <p>Raised in  Asmara, the capital city of Eritrea. Moved to Melbourne when I was 17, I am the oldest of six children. Given that I was the most mature. I lived my entire time trying to help out my parents in terms of financial support, I always ranked poorly in school as I never had enough time to study, but I never give up on it, got my diploma in building design from Gordon institute, also  now I'm working on getting my diploma in IT (web development)
          course because I find the problem-solving part of coding fun and interesting and also found coding interesting, being front end developer is ideal goal. </p>
